# NOTE

This is mainly the v0.32 typings with a few updates for v1. The level of v1 compliance will improve over time.

Below is a list of components that have started to be updated/checked and (at least to some extent) to work:

- Container (renamed from Grid)
- Col
- Row
- Dropdown (inc .Toggle .Menu, .Item)
- NavDropdown (inc. Item)
- Navbar (inc .Brand .Toggle .Collapse)
- ButtonGroup
- Button

Many other v0.32 definitions may work for you 'out of the box' or with minor edits.
